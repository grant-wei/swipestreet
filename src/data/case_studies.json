      "content": "By 2008, AIG had transformed from a conservative insurance giant into a leveraged bet on mortgage derivatives. Its Financial Products division had written $440B in credit default swaps on subprime mortgages. The company had strayed far from its core insurance operations into complex financial instruments it didn't fully understand.",
      "expanded": "The $182B government bailout saved AIG from bankruptcy, but came with a price: the U.S. Treasury took a 92% stake. CEO Robert Benmosche, brought in 2009, focused the company back on its core property-casualty and life insurance businesses. Over 5 years, AIG sold $70B in assets.\n\nBy 2012, AIG had fully repaid the government bailout plus $22.7B in profit to taxpayers. The company returned to the S&P 500 and began paying dividends again in 2013. The restructured AIG was fundamentally different: smaller, simpler, and focused on insurance.\n\nLesson: Turnarounds require painful focus. AIG's recovery came from selling beloved businesses and returning to basics. The best path forward often means becoming smaller, not bigger.",

      "content": "In 2016, iPhone growth was slowing. Wall Street valued Apple at 10x earnings - a 'hardware discount' reflecting fears of smartphone commoditization. The bear case was simple: Apple was a one-product company with 70% of revenue from iPhone. When smartphone growth slowed, Apple would become a value trap.",
      "expanded": "Apple began breaking out Services revenue separately in 2016, revealing a $25B business growing 20%+ annually. Tim Cook pivoted investor focus from iPhone units to the 1B+ active device installed base and recurring revenue from App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and later TV+, Arcade, and Fitness+.\n\nServices grew from $25B in 2016 to $85B+ by 2024. Apple's P/E expanded from 10x to 25-30x as investors re-rated the stock as a recurring revenue business. The math was powerful: Services carried 70%+ gross margins vs. 35% for hardware.\n\nLesson: Valuation is about narrative as much as numbers. Apple didn't just grow Services - they taught investors to value them differently. The installed base was always there; the story changed.",

      "content": "In 2007, Netflix was a successful DVD-by-mail company with 7M subscribers and $1.2B revenue. The business was profitable with strong unit economics. Why change anything? Reed Hastings saw that broadband speeds were improving exponentially. Within 5-10 years, streaming would be viable. Netflix could disrupt itself, or be disrupted.",
      "expanded": "Netflix launched streaming in 2007 as a free add-on to DVD subscriptions. The key insight was licensing economics - content deals were initially cheap because studios didn't understand streaming's potential. Netflix locked in multi-year deals at favorable rates before competitors noticed.\n\nBy 2024, Netflix had 260M+ streaming subscribers globally. DVD-by-mail was finally shut down in 2023. The 2011 Qwikster debacle cost 800K subscribers and 75% of stock value, but Netflix recovered and emerged stronger.\n\nLesson: It's better to cannibalize yourself than be disrupted by others. Netflix sacrificed short-term DVD profits to build a streaming moat that competitors couldn't replicate. Start transitions early when you have runway.",

Under Steve Ballmer, Microsoft was notoriously protective of Windows - internal projects that threatened Windows revenue were killed.",
      "expanded": "Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014 and immediately shifted focus to 'cloud-first, mobile-first.' He killed Windows Phone, embraced Linux, and bet everything on Azure. His cultural shift was as important as his strategic shift - he replaced stack-ranking with growth mindset and made peace with competitors.\n\nMicrosoft's market cap grew from $300B in 2014 to over $3T by 2024. Azure became the #2 cloud platform. Cloud revenue went from ~$4B to $100B+. The AI partnership with OpenAI positioned Microsoft for the next platform shift.\n\nLesson: Culture eats strategy for breakfast. Nadella's technical strategy was sound, but his cultural transformation enabled Microsoft to execute. Protect your future, not your past.",

Same-store sales fell 30%. The stock dropped from $750 to $250. Customers who once evangelized the brand now feared it.",
      "expanded": "Founder Steve Ells struggled to recover trust. In 2018, the board brought in Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol. He focused on food safety systems, digital ordering (which grew to 50% of revenue), and marketing that emphasized quality without dwelling on the crisis.\n\nBy 2024, Chipotle traded at all-time highs above $3,000/share (pre-split). Brand trust rebuilt gradually through consistent execution. Digital infrastructure built during the crisis became a moat when COVID hit - Chipotle was already prepared for takeout/delivery.\n\nLesson: Crisis recovery requires new leadership and forward focus. Ells was too associated with the crisis. Niccol could rebuild without baggage. Crisis investment can become competitive advantage.",
